The "show" command displays a histogram, showing how much of the
infile image is represented by each of 16 named greyscale colors.

Note that the image is *assumed* to be a greyscale!

One of two additional flags can be used:

--color will return a number representing the percentage of that 
named greyscale color in the image

--top will return the top n highest-frequency colors in the image
