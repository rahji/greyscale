The 'show colors' command displays a histogram, showing how much of
the infile image is represented by each of 16 named greyscale colors.

Note that the image is *assumed* to be a greyscale!

One of three additional flags can be used:

--color will return a number representing the percentage of that 
named greyscale color in the image

--top will return the top n highest-frequency colors in the image

--pixels shows the histogram only for pixels in the range x,y:x,y
